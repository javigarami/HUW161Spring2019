<h1>Cooper & Wilson Co.</h1>
<h3>H1 | Sacramento | 36px</h3>
<br>

<h2>This is my font selection. I chose Lora for the secondary headings and other text to create a contrast between the company's main header
  which is a semi connected script style of typography and the typeface chosen for larger text blocks. This promotes
easy reading on the website and allows the brand to express itself using the Sacramento typeface as an accent. </h2>
<h3>H2 | Lora,400 | 18px</h3>
<br>

<p> Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. </p>
<h3>P | Lora,100 | 14px</h3>
